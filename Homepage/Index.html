<h1>Rethinking Reading</h1>

<p>Reading is a designed experience based on efficiency and clarity for the user. For time, it has been
highly limited and restricted to the printed page or the physical platforms in which text is
presented. Screens have since provided a new space for reading, and with this new space comes new
opportunities to enhance the designed experience on how we read. While we still highly reference
printed and physical aspects of conventional reading such as the page and space, the screen and the
web provides us with an abstract and flexible space for reading to be presented. These traditional
aspects of reading can be rethought and redesigned rather than translated to fit the screen. By
deconstructing the process on how we read and how our brain reacts to reading I am able to design
new experiences for the reader. These experiments consist of 4 explorations that challenge and
recreates limitations and conventions of standard printed reading.</p>
