<h2>Experiments In Reading On Screen</h2>

<div class="description">
<h1>Flexible Legibility</h1>
<p>Reading is a designed experience based on efficiency and clarity for the user. For time, it has been highly limited and restricted to the printed page or the physical platforms in which text is presented. Screens have since provided a new space for reading, and with this new space comes new opportunities to enhance the designed experience on how we read. While we still highly reference printed and physical aspects of conventional reading such as the page and space, the screen and the web provides us with an abstract and flexible space for reading to be presented. These traditional aspects of reading can be rethought and redesigned rather than translated to fit the screen. By deconstructing the process on how we read and how our brain reacts to reading I am able to design new experiences for the reader. These experiments consist of 4 explorations that challenge and recreates limitations and conventions of standard printed reading.</p>

<p id="flip">There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs- commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there</p>
